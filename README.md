Quiz passed!
------------------------------------------------------------------
First assignment done for the University of Washington’s Machine Learning Foundations course in regression analysis.
There were 9 questions to answer having done the slides and practicals for week 1. An interesting way to pass this assignment
– one has until the 9th October to get above 80% – so 8 out of 9 required. One can do the assignment at most 3 times in every 8 hour period. Anyway I got the following 9 questions correct on the first attempt
